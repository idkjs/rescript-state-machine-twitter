# Finite State Machines in ReScript

I saw this excellent blog post by [@erikras](https://twitter.com/erikras), [Finite State Machines in ReScript](https://erikras.com/blog/finite-state-machines-in-rescript), but he didn't show the code implementing though he provides a demo on the blog post.

I needed to know how to implement it so I when ahead and did it.

# Running

```sh
> yarn && yarn dev
```
